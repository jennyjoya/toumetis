# Toumetis data scientist interview exercise

## Overview

The objective of this exercise is to design a model that can classify the operational mode of a set of industrial machines. 

A fleet of 36 machines of the same type has been instrumented with a set of sensors. Each machine was then operated across several different modes and the data from the sensors, along with the tis operating mod,e has been collected and stored in a time series data base. 

A csv dump of the database including the expert labels has been made avaialble to support this task

## Requirements

1. Design a model that can classify the operational mode of a machine based on its time series data.
2. Report the performance of the model.
3. Provide the code used to do exploritory data analysis, clean and transform the data, fit a model & determine & report its performance in a jupyter notebook. 
4. The analysis should be carried out using python.
5. Use a deep neural network type model for the classifier
6. Be prepared to discuss in detail your approach to solving this problem and explain your results. 



## Data

Use the dataset in the `data/` directory. The **operational_mode** column is the target variable.

## Submission

Send the notebook and any instructions/other artefacts required to make running of the notebook repeatable to admin@toumetis.com a day before you're 2nd interview date. Please don't submit a pull request or other condidates will be able to copy you're answer!
