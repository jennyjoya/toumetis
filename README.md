# Toumetis data scientist interview exercise

## Overview

A fleet of 36 industrial machines, of the same type, have been instrumented with a set of sensors. Each machine was then operated across several different operational modes. The data from the sensors, has been collected and stored in a time series data base. Sequences of the data have then been analysed by an expert and labeled with the correct operating mode.

The objective of this exercise is to design a model that can correctly classify the operational mode of a machine based purely on its sensor data.

A csv dump of the database including the operating mode labels has been made avaialble to support this task.

## Requirements

1. Design a model that can classify the operational mode of a machine based on its time series data.
2. Report the performance of the model.
3. Provide the code used to do exploritory data analysis, clean and transform the data, fit a model & determine & report its performance in a jupyter notebook. 
4. The analysis should be carried out using python.
5. Use a deep neural network type model for the classifier
6. Be prepared to discuss in detail your approach to solving this problem and explain your results. 

## Data

Use the dataset in the `data/` directory. The **operational_mode** column is the target variable.

## Submission

Send the notebook and any instructions/other artefacts required to make running of the notebook repeatable to admin@toumetis.com a day before you're 2nd interview date. Please don't submit a pull request or other candidates will be able to copy you're answer!
